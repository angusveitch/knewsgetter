Trove KnewsGetter - a Knime workflow for downloading newspaper data from Trove.

To install this workflow, first download and install Knime, then load the workflow by using the 'Import KNIME workflow' command in the File menu of Knime.

To use the workflow, you will need a key for the Trove API. For instructions about how to get one, visit http://help.nla.gov.au/trove/building-with-trove/api.

Further instructions can be found within the worklfow itself. If you can't see them, then I probably can't help you more than I already have. But if you have found a bug, do let me know, as this workflow has not yet been tested very extensively.

Good luck, and happy news-getting!
